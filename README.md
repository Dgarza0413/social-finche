# Synopsis
This app uses a react for front-end display, express for backend routing, and google firebase for our database. 

# about index.js
Once we establish GET and POST routes for moving data to firestore we initalize with `admin.firestore().collection('collection'`


### notes about firebase
Using firebase what feels different is the control of documents and the pacing of deploying applications
